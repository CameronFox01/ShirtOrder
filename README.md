# Shirt Order

#### Cameron Fox — 12/10/2025

## Overview

**Shirt Order** is a small utility designed to eliminate manual counting and reduce errors when placing shirt orders. Instead of spending time tallying sizes and categories by hand, this project performs the calculations automatically, providing clear totals and summaries.

The tool is intended for quick, repeatable use when ordering shirts for events, teams, or organizations, where accuracy and speed matter.

---

## Motivation

Shirt ordering often involves:

* Counting multiple sizes across different categories
* Verifying totals multiple times to avoid mistakes
* Repeating the same math for every order

This project automates that process so the focus can stay on organizing the order rather than double-checking arithmetic.

## Current Features

* **Unisex Counting and Gendered Counting**

    * Accurately calculates the total number of shirts when provided with male and female counts.
    * Combines these values into a single unisex total to simplify ordering.

* **Automated Totals**

    * Removes the need for manual counting.
    * Ensures consistent and repeatable results.

---

## How It’s Used (High-Level)

1. Enter the number of shirts by category (e.g., male and female counts).
2. The program calculates the total number of shirts required.
3. Use the output directly for placing or verifying an order.

*(Exact input/output details may vary depending on how the program is run.)*

## Improvements & Roadmap

* **Selection Menu**

    * Allow users to choose what data they want to view or calculate.
    * Replace default behavior with a simple main menu for navigation.

* **Cross-Platform Distribution**

    * Provide a Windows `.exe` file. **COMPLETED**
    * Provide a macOS version for easier setup and use without manual configuration.

* **Quality-of-Life Enhancements (Future)**

    * Clearer output formatting
    * Input validation to prevent mistakes
    * Potential export of results for record-keeping

## Project Status

* Core functionality is implemented and working.
* Unisex shirt counting improvements are complete.
* Additional usability and distribution improvements are planned.
